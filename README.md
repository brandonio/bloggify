# bloggify
I wrote this Python program to help me focus on blogging, rather than writing HTML. I have several easter eggs and special stylings throughout my blog, and coding those is meticulous. I also didn't want to have to continually add links to blogs on my main and error pages by hand. Now, I just write a post and run the program; the text is converted into HTML and written to the appropriate directory, and the main and error pages are modified to link to the new post. From there, I simply commit and push.
