# bloggify
I wrote this Python program to help me focus on blogging, rather than writing HTML files for my posts. I have several easter eggs and special stylings throughout my blog, and coding those is meticulous. Now, I just write a post, run the program, then input a post number, title, and color; the file is written to the appropriate folder so I simply commit and push.
